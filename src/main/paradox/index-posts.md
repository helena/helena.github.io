## July 2020

We're in a global crisis with multiple interconnected systems moving toward collapse.
Problems spanning the planet make the word complexity seem simplistic. 
Environmental, human and planetary forces form a continuously changing complex **System of Systems** and networks.
Climate change combined with human nature seem to be the largest stumbling blocks.
Habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, poverty, poaching and illegal wildlife trade are increasing exponentially
in relation to climate change. 
 
I hit a point where my involvement from the sidelines was no longer enough, and
in early 2020 left my 20-year career in tech to return to the scientific community. 
My work now centers around solving these problems. I am happy to hear that my engineering background is needed in both research and implementation for change.
 
I am pursing a @ref:[Master's in Science](index-research.md) and considering a PhD, toward long-term goals to create innovative ways to protect endangered, threatened and vulnerable wildlife and habitat
through sustainable solutions.
