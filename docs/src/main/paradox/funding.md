# Funding 

## Science and technology

I have started seeking research funding and am open to being approached by VC firms to funding projects that leverage the latest 
innovations in technology applied to solving environmental problems.

Currently, I am looking into innovative technical solutions to apply to helping solve
issues surrounding endangered, threatened and vulnerable species.

Contact me via LinkedIn [@helenaedelson](https://twitter.com/helenaedelson) or

Specific research projects will soon be added soon to the @ref:[research](index.md) page.
