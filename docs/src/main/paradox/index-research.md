My current work focus is wolf conservation in the Northern Rockies and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
I move between Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, focusing on those populations, their prey, habitat and population migration corridors.

My 2020-2021 research focus was snow leopard, with the long-term goals of helping endangered species 
in the context of climate change, solve human-wildlife conflict, illegal trade and poaching 
through sustainable solutions. I will be doing interdisciplinary research on
wildlife, habitat and climate:

* through the lens of complex adaptive systems
* using AI, game theory, aerial robotics and IoT 
* leveraging my 25 years in tech building massively scalable data systems for security, anomaly detection and real-time response 

to collect and share richer data. My work will be in the service of building and deploying successful solutions where science 
and technology can overcome limited resources on the ground, which is urgently needed in conflict zones.
